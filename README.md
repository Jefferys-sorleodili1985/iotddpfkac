Wow, just finished watching The Monkey and, like, seriously? I have so many thoughts bouncing around my head. That movie is wild, man. Like, it’s this rollercoaster where I’m not sure if I’m laughing or just confused half the time. You know what I mean? It’s like, why would they choose a monkey to do all that crazy stuff? But then again, maybe that’s the genius of it, or maybe I just missed something while checking my phone. I swear, I didn’t even mean to download the movie, but I'm kinda glad I did? Or maybe not. I’m so undecided. Haha!

> So I started thinking, if I was at a fancy dinner with this monkey, what food would it even go for? I feel like it would be one of those people who order everything on the menu “to try it out” and don't even eat half of it. Whatever, it sounds like me actually, minus the monkey part, I mean. 😂 But seriously, why was I even thinking about food after watching the movie? Maybe I was just hungry. Wait, no, I was definitely hungry.

Anyway, the whole monkey saves the day thing, I mean is that really believable? Like, only in the world of movies. And I'm just here, trying to wrap my head around how the writers even came up with that plot. It’s like they just threw darts at some insane ideas board. Still, it was kinda refreshing compared to all the cliché stuff lately. Maybe I should have paid more attention instead of multitasking. Lesson learned for the next time I finally get around to actually watch the movie properly without interruptions.

printf(Why am I even thinking this late?);

I dunno, maybe I’m just overthinking it. Or maybe it’s the leftover takeout talking. But anyway, bottom line, I can’t decide if I loved it or I’m just perplexed. But hey, sometimes that’s the best kind of movie, right? Keeps me chatting more, and isn’t that the point? 😂 Let’s catch up tomorrow, coffee?
